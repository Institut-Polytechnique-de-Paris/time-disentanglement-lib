## Tests

To run the tests locally, you can follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. Install pytest by executing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
$ pip install pytest
```

2. Once pytest is installed, you can launch the tests. In this example, we assume that you are in the project's root folder. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
$ pytest .
```

The dot (`.`) after `pytest` indicates that you want to run all the tests in the current directory. If your tests are located in a specific file or directory, replace the dot with the corresponding path.

Make sure to execute these commands in your terminal or command prompt. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions and dependencies set up before running the tests locally.

By following these steps, you should be able to install pytest and run the tests successfully on your local machine.
